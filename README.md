# Create a calendar file with this week's menu

Currently only one menu crawler is implemented for the restaurant Ideon Edison.

Run it with:

`scrapy crawl edison`

to create `edison.ics` which contains this week's menu as daily calendar entries 11:30-12:00. 

Open the file with your preferred application:

`open Ideon Edison.ics`

Enjoy!
